# Graph

This project was my attempt at solving the task of maximizing the shortest path cost in a graph by removing up to a given number of edges and vertices. This problem is a very famous graph problem that currently does not have a complete solution. I used 900 input graphs varying from small, medium, and large sizes. I created multiple subroutines that optimized the output and algorithm runtime based on the graph input size, as a subroutine that was optimal for smaller graphs often took many hours to days to run on larger graphs. I experimented with many approaches, such as brute force, betweenness centrally heuristics, and probabilistic recursion.
